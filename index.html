        <p class="hometekst"> Penguin Paradise Shelter is a new company that owns multiple penguin shelters. <br>
        Our company was created due to how much we dislike how zoo animals are held <br>
            in zoos/prisons all over the world.
            We are strongly against animal cruelty and want <br>
            to remove all zoos not letting the animals live in their natural climate with natural surroundings. <br>
            Our favourite animal is penguins.
            Therefore our shelters are all nearby to McMurdo Station in Antarctica. <br>
            We plan and make flights for you so that is no worry, just head over to contact us! The shelters are massive <br>
            and we plan trips with a tour-guide if wanted, or you can go by yourself. We recommend going with a <br>
            tour-guide if you don't know how to operate a snowmobile or a so called "snow-car". You have to pay a deposit <br>
            if you choose to not go with a guide in case of any accidents.
